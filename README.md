CountESS
========

CountESS (Count-based Experiment Scoring and Statistics) is a general software tool for processing, analyzing, and visualizing data from high-throughput functional genomics experiments based on count data, such as deep mutational scanning.

This project extends previous work on Enrich2 by moving from Python 2.7 to Python 3.6+ and add adding new features to improve performance and enable analysis of new types of data.
